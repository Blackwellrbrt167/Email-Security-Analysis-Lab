This folder stores all screenshot evidence used throughout the Email Security Analysis Lab.
Screenshots are not embedded inside Markdown files—they are linked.
GitHub requires images to exist as real files inside the repository for them to display correctly.

Keeping screenshots here ensures:

Clear separation between analysis, raw samples, labels, and visual evidence

A consistent folder structure that scales as additional email analyses are added

Recruiters and reviewers can easily browse the evidence supporting each investigation

Markdown links inside /analysis remain valid and never break
