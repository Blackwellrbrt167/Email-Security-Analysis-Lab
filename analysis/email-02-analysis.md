## Initial Risk Assessment

- **Does the email try to get me to click a link, open an attachment, or sign in?**  
  No. There were *no links, attachments, or sign-in prompts* in the email body.

- **Does the sender seem unusual or unknown?**  
  Yes. The sender is unknown, and the content appears unusual because it references **“UN accounts,”** which is atypical for legitimate communication.

- **Is there urgency, threats, money claims, or account warnings?**  
  Yes. The email contains **money-related claims**, including:  
  *“The auditor report shows that you have been going through hard times by paying a lot of money to certain groups of individuals for the transfer of funds to your bank account.”*

- **Does the branding appear suspicious?**  
  Yes. The email does **not** appear to come from any recognized organization, company, or marketing source.
